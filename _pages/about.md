<span class='anchor' id='about-me'></span>
I'm a second-year M.sc. student at [SUSTech](https://www.sustech.edu.cn/en/), advised by [Prof. Hong Zhang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=J7UkpAIAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

I am a robotics perception researcher, dedicated to enabling robots to better perceive 3D environments, thereby improving their performance in downstream tasks such as scene understanding, navigation, and grasping. To achieve this goal, I am currently focused on: (a) SLAM; (b) differentiable dense map representations.

[Optimizing NeRF-based SLAM with Trajectory Smoothness Constraints](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2410.08780)

**Yicheng He**, Guangcheng Chen, Hong Zhang

- Identified the lack of trajectory smoothness in NeRF-SLAM due to missing explicit constraints.
- Proposed a B-spline trajectory representation and jointly optimized it with NeRF to achieve smooth camera motion.

[Pisr: Polarimetric neural implicit surface reconstruction for textureless and specular objects](https://arxiv.org/pdf/2409.14331))

Guangcheng Chen, **Yicheng He**, Li He & Hong Zhang

- Identified radiance-color ambiguity in NeRF methods, leading to poor reconstruction of textureless or reflective objects.
- Integrated polarization cues and a normal-based loss to enhance NeRF optimization and reconstruction quality.
